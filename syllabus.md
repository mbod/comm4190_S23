# Course Description Goals and Objectives

Increasingly, our daily communications involve responding to and
interacting with language produced by artificial intelligence
models. On the surface, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI
tools (e.g ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) appear to have crossed a milestone in
terms of their human-like ability to generate coherent and idiomatic
texts. This has significant implications (both positive and negative)
for human communication systems and their products, from creative
fiction to news, from academic texts to social media content. It also
raises many questions around whether we can identify, trust, learn
from and use AI generated language.

In this course, we will begin to answer these questions in two
ways:

1.  Analyzing Key Issues: Drawing upon relevant frameworks in communication

and language theory we will explore the transformative nature of
AI-generated communication and its impact on individuals and society.

1.  Hands-on Application: In parallel, students will

acquire skills using Python in implementing machine and deep learning
models to better understand how they work and explore their abilities
and limitations. We will code various AI models, such as a simple
voice assistant, image classifier, misinformation identifier, and a
basic text generative application.

Through this course students will be equipped for a range of
contexts impacted by developments in AI. The course
requires students to have a basic experience in Python coding and
using Jupyter notebooks.


## Objectives

Through this course students will:

-   Develop an understanding of how LLMs work at various conceptual
    levels (above the low-level technical/mathematical), including the
    three stages of training (pre-training, fine-tuning and RLHF) and
    the key component of these models, namely the `Transformer`

-   Consider questions of:
    -   `how` and `what` LLMs learn during training and ongoing usage
    -   what level and kind of (if any) understanding and representation of meaning do LLMs exhibit and actually have
    -   to what extent are LLMs able to reason, plan, create models of the world and others (e.g. Theory of Mind)
    -   what kinds of `emergent` knowledge and behaviors LLMs seem to
        exhibit as they increase in size (of both data and parameters) and the implications of these phenomena

-   Learn the basic theoretical framework and concepts from pragmatics
    (the theory of `meaning in context` in language use) and consider and test `if` and `how` LLMs are able to


# Assessment

-   Prompt/response and readings logbook (20%)

-   Research project (20%)

-   Coding assignments (20%)

-   Final Project (40%)


# Textbooks and recommended readings


## Textbooks

Mitchell, M. (2019) *Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking
Humans*.


# Schedule


## **NOTE** This is a tentative schedule is will be updated as the course progresses


## Class structure

-   Usually each class session will be divided into two parts:

-   **Content and Discussion** - This part of the class will introduce
    and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important
    that you read the assigned material BEFORE the class as you'll be
    expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this
    content.
-   **Lab activities** - The second part will be focused on pratical
    exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about
    thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and
    communicating data. This will include learning some basic steps
    using Python and R scripts and some other tools for data analysis
    and visualization.
